# this site contains all necessary files to run "A Walk Home"
# to download the raw Python file and run it on your own device, download the .py file and run it (directly in Python in Windows OS, in Terminal in Mac OS)
# to have me do all the heavy lifting for you (if you're on Windows!), download the .exe.exe file - your computer will warn you like three times that it doesn't know what the file is. that's because I wrote the file. there is no trojan horse virus in my dinky video game (although that's what a phisher would say). tell your computer to ignore it, download the file, find it in your downloads and the game should launch when you open that file!
# the HTML file has the metadata for the game and the libraries I used to build it
# to report issues, don't hesitate to leave a comment here (or if you know me, contact me directly)
# roll Blount :)
